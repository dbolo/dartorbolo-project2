<h2>All about Liberia</h2>
		
<p> Liberia was founded in the early 1800s, this  was motivated by the domestic politics of slavery and race in the United States as well as by U.S. foreign policy interests. 
		In 1816, a group of white Americans founded the American Colonization Society (ACS) to deal with the “problem” of the growing number of free blacks in the United States by resettling them in Africa.
		The resulting state of Liberia would become the second (after Haiti) black republic in the world at that time.</p>
